title: "Setup and use VNC server"
---

Article consists of two part: first part describes how to setup server and second is about client.
In both cases TigerVNC will be used.

**VNC server**

Server is running on Linux (Ubuntu). First  install required packages (JWM will be used as desktop environment):

```
$ sudo apt install tigervnc-standalone-server jwm
```

Then set password which client will use later to connect:

```
$ vncpasswd
```

On start TigerVNC will read configuration from the `/etc/vnc.conf` and then run script `/etc/X11/Xvnc-session`.
Both files can be overridden with the corresponding files in the directory `$HOME/.vnc`.
Possible content of those file is below (system files can be used as reference).

*$HOME/.vnc/vnc.conf*

```
$SecurityTypes = "VncAuth,TLSVnc";
$geometry ="800x600";
```

*$HOME/.vnc/Xvnc-session* (must be executable)

```
#!/bin/sh
vncconfig -nowin &
exec jwm
```

After configuration is in place server can be started with:

```
$ vncserver
```

**VNC client**

Under OS X client can be installed with *brew*:

```
$ brew cask install tigervnc-viewer
```

Interface is self-explanatory.
